Hi! I'm Karthik Rajkumar, and this markdown file is a documentation of the problems I have to solve in order to advance in OverTheWire's Bandit course.

<h2>Level 0</h2>

The 0th level of the Bandit course is a simple one. Log into the bandit remote server via SSH. This was a bit tricky to me since I had no prior experience with SSH (I knew the meaning and purpose it had, but never worked with it). One youtube video later however caught me up to speed and I managed to log in successfully, via OpenSSH on my Windows machine.

<h2>Level 0 -> 1</h2>

Now I had to access level 1, via a password found in level 0. It was contained in a readme text file, and was easy enough to open via the cat command. I had prior experience using bash commands from a Version Control course i took in my 1st year (I don't think I ever completed it though... haha...).
